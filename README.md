# CNS-Lab-2023
This repo will act as  medium to hold my work for Computer network and security for the fall 2023 semester. I will be pushing my work and notes to this repository.


I installed the binary version of Vagrant on my host system. After downloading the binary package from the official Vagrant website, I opened a terminal window and went to the directory with the binary. I executed the binary using the "./vagrant" command to make sure it was running. I downloaded the AMD64 version for windows from the install vagrant section because I had issues with the other package. I then moved the binary to the "/usr/local/bin/" directory using the "sudo mv" command. Next, I used the "which vagrant" command in the terminal, which confirmed that the Vagrant binary was successfully installed and located at "/usr/local/bin/vagrant". Now, I can conveniently use Vagrant commands from any directory in the terminal.
