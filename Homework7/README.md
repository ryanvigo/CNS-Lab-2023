## Vulnerable Service
The vulnerable service in focus is Nexus Repository Manager, a popular repository manager widely used in software development. Nexus Repository Manager facilitates the management of software artifacts and dependencies, making it a critical component in many software development workflows. This exploit targets a vulnerability in Nexus Repository Manager involving Java Expression Language (EL) Injection, designated as CVE-2020-7247. This vulnerability enables remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected system by injecting malicious Java EL expressions. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can gain unauthorized access and potentially compromise the entire system. Metasploit offers a specialized module tailored to exploit the Nexus Repository Manager Java EL Injection vulnerability. This module automates the exploitation process, simplifying the attack. By leveraging Metasploit, I can efficiently target vulnerable systems. To run this system in lab i will be using snap and docker to run an image as a container on the linux server. This will allow for an older version of Nexus Repository Manager that the exploit was tested on.
